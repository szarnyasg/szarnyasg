I'm a researcher interested in graph processing techniques with an emphasis on both raw performance and usability aspects (portability, expressive power, conciseness).
Most of my contributions are under the following organizations:

* [CWI Database Architectures group](https://github.com/cwida) (postdoc, 2020–)
* [Linked Data Benchmark Council](https://github.com/ldbc/) (benchmark task force lead, steering committee member, 2017–)
* [GraphBLAS](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/) (LAGraph contributor and tutorial maintainer, 2019–)
* [ftsrg](https://github.com/ftsrg) (PhD, 2014–2019)

I curate a number of repositories with pointers centered around a certain technology or algorithm family:

* [The GraphBLAS API and its ecosystem](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Pointers)
* [Research on graph processing using relational operators](https://github.com/szarnyasg/relational-graph-processing)
* [The (open)Cypher query language](https://github.com/szarnyasg/awesome-cypher)
* [The GQL and SQL/PGQ query languages](https://github.com/szarnyasg/gql-sql-pgq-pointers)
