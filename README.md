I'm a researcher interested in data management and grpah processing techniques.
I deem both raw performance and usability aspects (portability, expressive power, conciseness) equally important.
Most of my contributions are in these GitHub organizations and roles:

* [CWI Database Architectures group](https://github.com/cwida): post-doctoral researcher (2020–)
* [Linked Data Benchmark Council](https://github.com/ldbc/): benchmark contributor and task force lead (2017–), steering committee member (2017–2023)
* [GraphBLAS](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/): LAGraph contributor and tutorial maintainer (2019–)
* [ftsrg at Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://github.com/ftsrg): PhD in software engineering (2014–2019)

I curate a number of repositories with pointers centered around a certain technology or algorithm family:

* [The GraphBLAS API and its ecosystem](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Pointers)
* [Research on graph processing using relational operators](https://github.com/szarnyasg/relational-graph-processing)
* [The GQL and SQL/PGQ query languages](https://github.com/szarnyasg/gql-sql-pgq-pointers)
